Example #1- 
Code snippet : 
num1 = 5
num2 = 7
result = num1 * num2 
print("The product of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))
PLAN: 
Step 1 : Variable Initialization: Set num1 to 5. Set num2 to 7. "num1 = 5" and "num2 = 7" will be executed.
Step 2: Operation: Multiply num1 and num2 and Store the result in the variable result. "result = num1 * num2 " will be executed.
Step 3: Display Result: Use the print function to display a formatted string. "print("The product of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))" will be executed

So the final code coverage will be :
> num1 = 5
> num2 = 7
> result = num1 * num2 
> print("The product of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))

Example 2 - 
Code snippet : 
number = 15
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("{} is an even number.".format(number))
else:
    print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))

PLAN : 
Step 1: Variable Initialization: Initialize the number variable with a specific value. In this case, it's set to 15. "number = 15" will be executed.
Step 2: Operation : Use the % (modulo) operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.If the result is 0, the number is even. If not, it's odd. 
Step 3: Branching if-else Block: Enter the if block if the number is even. Since 15%2 results in 1, Line 3 will not be executed but the else block if the number is odd. Statements "if number % 2 == 0:", "else:" and "print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))" will be executed.
Step 4: Output: The required print statement will be executed based on the output of the if-else block
So the final code coverage will be : 
> number = 15
> if number % 2 == 0:
!     print("{} is an even number.".format(number))
> else:
>     print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))

Example 3 - 
Code Snippet : 
val = 5
for i in range(val):
    print("Current number:", i)
print("Loop completed!")
PLAN: 
Step 1: Variable Initialization: Initialize variable 'val' to 5. "val = 5" will be executed
Step 2: For Loop Execution: Enter the for loop and iteratively assigne values to 'i' from 0 to val-1. Inside the for loop, Print the current value of i in each iteration."for i in range(val):" and "print("Current number:", i)" will be executed. 
Step 3: For Loop Exit: Exit the for loop after 'i' reaches the max limit val-1. Execute the code after the loop which is a print statement. "print("Loop completed!")" will be executed. 
So the final code coverage will be :
> val = 5
> for i in range(val):
>     print("Current number:", i)
> print("Loop completed!")
