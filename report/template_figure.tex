\begin{verbatim}
Input:

For the given code snippet, predict the code coverage.
The code coverage indicates whether a statement has been
executed or not.

> if the line is executed
! if the line is not executed

Example output:
> line1
! line2
> line3
...
> linen

You need to develop a plan for step by step execution of
the code snippet.

Do not answer unless instructed to do so

DISCLAIMER: Lines that are not executed are to be denoted
with a SINGLE '!' whereas lines that are executed are to be
denoted with a single '>'

Below are a couple examples of the process you need to follow
to predict the code coverage of a given code snippet and its
plan.

[example 1]

[example 2]

In a similar fashion, develop a PLAN of step by step execution
of the below code snippet and predict the CODE COVERAGE.

[code snippet]

Output:

[output plan]
[output code coverage]
