For the given code snippet, predict the code coverage. The code coverage indicates whether a statement has been executed or not. 
> if the line is executed
! if the line is not executed

Example output:
> line1
! line2
> line3
...
> linen

You need to develop a plan for step by step execution of the code snippet. 
Do not answer unless instructed to do so
